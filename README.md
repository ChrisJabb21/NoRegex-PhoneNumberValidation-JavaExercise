# NoRegex-PhoneNumberValidation-JavaExercise

 REGEX Exercise

For this example, assume a valid telephone number is 10 digits long. 
However, it cannot have the number 911 in any part of the phone number.
 In your program, have the user enter a phone number and tell them
 if it is a valid phone number or not WITHOUT USING REGEX.


 See below for what counts as valid inputs. 
Remember to check for inputs with correctly formatted parenthesis and dashes.

# Valid:
